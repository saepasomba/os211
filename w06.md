### 4. [States of A Process in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/states-of-a-process-in-operating-systems/)
This website shows how states of a process work. It is easy to understand because it gives points and highlight of each step of states of process. It also covers CPU and IO Bound Processes (and it's types) and multiprogramming (and it's types).

### 5. [Processes in Operating System](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_processes.htm)
This website provides a great explanation about process. It covers a lot about process, such as definition, life cycle, and Process Control Block (PCB). I like it because it has great illustrations and has concise explanation.

### 6. [Process vs. Thread](https://www.guru99.com/difference-between-process-and-thread.html)

### 9. [Deadlock in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-deadlock-in-operating-system/)
Deadlock is also a new term for me. It explains the term deadlock with a great illustration. It also provides exercise with kind of "readable" options.

### 10. [Makefile](https://makefiletutorial.com/)
