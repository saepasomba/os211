# Top 10 List of Week 04

### 1. [Logical vs. Physical Address](https://techdifferences.com/difference-between-logical-and-physical-address.html)
This website provides a good explanation of each type of address in a simple and easy to understand way. Basically, logical address is virtual address generated by CPU, while physical address is a location that exist in memory unit. 

### 2. [Static vs. Shared Libraries (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vp9cFQCQCo)
This video explains the definition of library, how static & shared libraries works and their pros & cons. The key difference between static and shared libraries is the link time (when our program reference the library). Static does it while compiling (at the very last) and shared does it while run time.

### 3. [Little Endian & Big Endian (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcaiHcBvDR4)
This video helps me recall the difference between little endian and big endian. It also gives the story why it's called little endian and big endian (clue: an egg). This video is great because it provides animations that help me to visualize the bit ordering.

### 4. [Pointers vs. References](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pointers-vs-references-cpp/)
At the beginning of reading resources, I tohught pointers is the same with reference. After reading this website, I realized that they are not the same (even though they are similar). The key sentence I got from this website is "A reference can be thought of as a constant pointer (not to be confused with a pointer to a constant value!) with automatic indirection, i.e the compiler will apply the * operator for you.".

### 5. [Paging](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/paging-in-operating-system/)
This website gives great explaination about paging. In a nutshell, paging is memory management scheme to divide allocation of physical memory into blocks (non contiguous). Also, these blocks is called pages.

### 6. [Executable File](https://techterms.com/definition/executable_file)
Executable file is very common. This website gives the basic idea of what is executable file and how it behaves in different operating systems.

### 7. [Swapping](https://binaryterms.com/swapping-in-operating-system.html)
This website explains about how swapping works. Basically, any blocked/idle process in memory will be swapped by process that is ready to be executed. Where did the blocked/idle process go? To the backing storage (disk).

### 8. [Virtual Memory: 3 What is Virtual Memory? (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlH4-oHnBb8)
This video covers the concept of what is virtual memory and its usage. Virtual memory is the indericted secondary memory to act like main memory. This gives us the flexibility in how we use the main memory.

### 9. [Difference Between Memory and Storage in Computers](https://www.kingston.com/us/memory/difference-between-memory-storage)
Since I was a kid until senior high school, I thought memory is different with RAM and memory is storage. If I summarize this website, RAM(memory) is very fast and used for short term data access, while storage is slower than memory and used for storing and accessing data in long term basis.

### 10. [RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 10 - All You Need to Know as Fast As Possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE7Bfw9lFfs)
About 2 years ago, when I wanted to build PC online, there's an option to use RAID. I finally know what RAID means after watching this video. So basically, RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks) is a way to store data using multiple disk to achieve better performance and reliability depends on which type of RAID we're using.
