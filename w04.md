# Top 10 List of Week 04

### 1. [Logical Vs Physical Address](https://techdifferences.com/difference-between-logical-and-physical-address.html)
This website provides a good explanation of each type of address in a simple and easy to understand way. Basically, logical address is virtual address generated by CPU, while physical address is a location that exist in memory unit. 

### 2. [Static vs. Shared Libraries (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vp9cFQCQCo)
This video explains the definition of library, how static & shared libraries works and their pros & cons. The key difference between static and shared libraries is the link time (when our program reference the library). Static does it while compiling (at the very last) and shared does it while run time.

### 3. [Little Endian & Big Endian (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcaiHcBvDR4)
This video helps me recall the difference between little endian and big endian. It also gives the story why it's called little endian and big endian (clue: an egg). This video is great because it provides animations that help me to visualize the bit ordering.

### 4. [Pointers Vs References](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pointers-vs-references-cpp/)
At the beginning of reading resources, I tohught pointers is the same with reference. After reading this website, I realized that they are not the same (even though they are similar). The key sentence I got from this website is "A reference can be thought of as a constant pointer (not to be confused with a pointer to a constant value!) with automatic indirection, i.e the compiler will apply the * operator for you.".
