# Top 10 List of Week 08

### 1. [CPU Scheduling](https://www.guru99.com/cpu-scheduling-algorithms.html)
This website provides a great explanation about CPU scheduling. It covers Types of CPU scheduling (preemptive and non-preemptive), some CPU terminologies, and quite many more. This website is good because it provides detail information about CPU scheduling. It also has clear section and it highlights important thing to discuss.

### 2. [CPU and I/O Burst Cycles (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVzb3TUcDLo)
This video explains about CPU and I/O burst cycles. It provides great explanation because of its neat text placement and representation. It also quite concise, so it's quite fast to watch.

### 3. [Process State Models](https://slaystudy.com/process-state-models-in-operating-system/)
This website gives a great explanation about process state models, because it has good illustration about each process model (not every process model) and it also highlight important parts in the article. This website covers from 2 state until 7 state process model.

### 4. [Multiple Processor Scheduling in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multiple-processor-scheduling-in-operating-system/)
This article discusses about multiple processor scheduling. It covers quite a lot (asymmetric & symmetric multiprocessing, processor affinity, load balancing, multicore processors, and virtualization & threading).

### 5. [Scheduling in Real Time Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/scheduling-in-real-time-systems/)
This website explains about scheduling in real time systems. It covers the definition and scheduling algorithm classification. It is great because if its concise explanation and clear section.

### 6. [Arrival Vs. Burst Time](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-arrival-time-and-burst-time-in-cpu-scheduling/)
This website explains about the difference between arrival and burst time. This helps to complete my understanding from #2 link. Great section, great table.

### 7. [CPU Burst (Visualization)](http://cpuburst.com/)
This website helps to visualize CPU burst. It has visualization of Gantt Chart, CPU burst predictior, and Banker's algorithm.

### 8. [Big O Notation](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/big-o-notation-why-it-matters-and-why-it-doesnt-1674cfa8a23c/)
This website helpls me to recall the material about Big O Notation. It has comprehensive explanaton with flashy graph and everything. Great website.

### 9. [Soft Vs. Hard Real Time System](https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-hard-and-vs-soft-real-time-system/)
This website helps to complete the explanation of #5 link. It provides deeper differences between soft and hard real time system. It has table of the differences, so it is easier to compare each other.

### 10. [Symmetric & Asymmetric Multiprocessing](https://techdifferences.com/difference-between-symmetric-and-asymmetric-multiprocessing.html)
This website helps to complete #4 website. It has deeper explanation of the differences between symmetric and asymmetric multiprocessing. Great table to compare and clear section.
