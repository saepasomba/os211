# Top 10 List of Week 07

### 1. [Process Syncronization](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/process-synchronization)
This website provides a great explanation about process syncronization. It covers a lot, from dhe definition, race condition, critical section problem, solutions to critical problem, and some others. It is a good web because it has clear section and concise explanation.

### 2. [Race Conditions](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/race-conditions)
This web gives quite deep explanation about race condition (unlike website #1 that touches race condition slightly). It has great explanation and it highlights important parts.

### 3. [Deadlock](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-deadlock-in-operating-system/)
I already mentioned this web in W06's top 10 list. Just like before, this website explains the term deadlock with a great illustration. It also gives 1 excerciseabout deadlock.

### 4. [Deadlock Prevention](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/deadlock-prevention-in-operating-system)
After discussing about deadlock, let's talk about its prevention. This website covers deadlock prevention approaches, such as: Mutual Exclusion, Hold and Wait, No preemption, and Circular Wait. It has comprehensive explanation about each approach.

### 5. [Banker's Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bankers-algorithm-in-operating-system-2/)
This website explains about banker's algorithm which is used to avoid deadlock and manage resouce allocation. It's quite hard to understand at first, but it has complete explanation about banker's algorithm (even the code example!).

### 6. [Deadlock Vs. Starvation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-deadlock-and-starvation-in-os/)
This website has straight forward explanation about the differences between deadlock and starvation. Aside from being staright forward, it also provide table about each differences, so it's easier to compare.

### 7. [Critical Section Problem](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-critical-section-problem)
Critical section problem has already been mentioned in website #1. This web has a bit deeper explanation about critical section problem. Great website.

### 8. [Semaphores](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/semaphores-in-operating-system)
I heard semaphore a lot in sync class. This website helped me to keep up. It covers about the definition of semaphore, semaphore's types, adventages, and disadventages. It has clear section so it is easier to understand.

### 9. [Readers Writer Problem](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/readers-writer-problem)
This website explains the problem when multiple user can read the same file together, while only 1 user can write, no other process can access the resource. It provides great explanation and code example too.

### 10. [Linux File Permissions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/setuid-setgid-and-sticky-bits-in-linux-file-permissions/)
This website provides a great explanation about SetUID, SetGID, and Sticky Bits. It has examples for each process, so it is easier to understand and try.
