# Top 10 List of Week 02

### 1. [Operating System Security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKkOBClw1Q)
This video provides a great basic concept of security in operating system. I like it because it's only ~6 mins long and already covering basic concepts of security in operating system.

### 2. [Protection in Operating System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_WbprDZMDw)
This video shows a great concept of protection in operating system. I like it because it is quick (it even covers some access matrix), even though it's kind of hard to understand at first.

### 3. [www.learn-c.org](https://www.learn-c.org/)
This website provides an interactive tutorials to learn C (and other languages too). It assists me from the very basic thing (Hello world!).

### 4. [Symmetric Key and Public Key Encryption](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERp8420ucGs)
This video gives a great explanation of the difference between symmetric key and asymmetric/public key encryption. It's kind of the same with explanation in websites, but I prefer this video because it has cool animation flow that shows how data is encrypted.

### 5. [SHA: Secure Hashing Algorithm - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMtFhACPnTY)
This video shows how SHA works. So basically, SHA will have a loop that will updates the hash until there's no message left. Kind of confusing at first to be honest, but it get easier to understand after a rewatch.
