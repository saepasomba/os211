# Top 10 List of Week 02

### 1. [Operating System Security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKkOBClw1Q)
This video provides a great basic concept of security in operating system. I like it because it's only ~6 mins long and already covering basic concepts of security in operating system.

### 2. [Protection in Operating System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_WbprDZMDw)
This video shows a great concept of protection in operating system. I like it because it is quick (it even covers some access matrix), even though it's kind of hard to understand at first.

### 3. [Cryptography - Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf9KjCKmDcU&list=PL7AEDF86AABA1AA9A)
This video playlist explains the definition of cryptography and why it is created. It also shows some ciphers examples and it's flaw. For example, Caesar Ciphers can be cracked by character frequency clue depending the language used.

### 4. [What is Malware?](https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/antivirus/malware.html)
This website explains how different types of malware works. This is an eye opening for me because I thought virus and malware is the same thing.

### 5. [www.learn-c.org](https://www.learn-c.org/)
This website provides an interactive tutorials to learn C (and other languages too). It assists me from the very basic thing (Hello world!).

### 6. [Symmetric Key and Public Key Encryption](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERp8420ucGs)
This video gives a great explanation of the difference between symmetric key and asymmetric/public key encryption. It's kind of the same with explanation in websites, but I prefer this video because it has cool animation flow that shows how data is encrypted.

### 7. [SHA: Secure Hashing Algorithm - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMtFhACPnTY)
This video shows how SHA works. So basically, SHA will have a loop that will updates the hash until there's no message left. Kind of confusing at first to be honest, but it get easier to understand after a rewatch.

### 8. [Biometric authentication, the good, the bad, and the ugly](https://www.onelogin.com/learn/biometric-authentication)
At first, I searched if hacker can breach biometric authentication. And the answer is YES and kind of scary. If a hacker can get your fingerprint data, imagine the power he holds! You can get a lifelong risk of being hacked. This website explains it also other pros and cons of biometric authentication.
