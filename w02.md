# Top 10 List of Week 02

### 1. [Operating System Security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kKkOBClw1Q)
This video provides a great basic concept of security in operating system. I like it because it's only ~6 mins long and already covering basic concepts of security in operating system.

### 2. [Protection in Operating System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_WbprDZMDw)
This video shows a great concept of protection in operating system. I like it because it is quick (it even covers some access matrix), even though it's kind of hard to understand at first.

### 3. [www.learn-c.org](https://www.learn-c.org/)
This website provides an interactive tutorials to learn C (and other languages too). It assists me from the very basic thing (Hello world!).
